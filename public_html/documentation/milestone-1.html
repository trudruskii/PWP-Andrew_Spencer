            <h1 class="font-bold">Purpose</h1>
            <p>This webpage is going to act as my professional web development portfolio. These aspects will cover things like exemplifying my current skill level with using coding languages such as CSS and Javascript. I'd really like it to be the hub for all of my projects that I'm either working on or have completed over time.</p>
<!--         What would you like your PWP to help you accomplish? This is a high-level goal akin to a Mission Statement.-->
            <h1 class="font-bold">Audience</h1>
            <p>Once I have my page completely established, up and running, I'll use this page to share my current skill-set with my friends, family, potential employers and co-workers to expand my connections in not just the tech world but also in a social sense.</p>
<!--         Who will be using or viewing your site? Who is this site designed for, and who is your audience comprised of? Could it be for your professional peers and other developers, potential employers, customers or clients, ect..?-->
            <h1 class="font-bold">Goals</h1>
            <p>I hope that my PWP will become a nice reference point for me to look at and see what I have accomplished with my skill level as a web developer. Hopefully it will also attract people to want to utilize the education I have and  potentially hire me to do some free lance work.</p>
<!--            This should be a quantifiable goal if possible. For example, a goal for your PWP could be:-->
<!--            To acquire full or part-time employment or internship.-->
<!--            To increase sales and/or conversion rates for an existing business.-->
<!--            To attract freelance clients.-->
<!--            To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.-->
<!--            To increase the reach of a new or established social media presence (as measured via analytics tools).-->

            <p>Julie spends most of her time looking at a screen, whether that be on her camera, cell phone or her laptop focusing on capturing the perfect picture or tweaking it to look just right. She's extremely meticulous with how things look and it really frustrates her to see things unorganized. If a person's portfolio or resume isn't structured and displays creativity then she won't even spend more than a second to consider them as an option to hire. She expects the person she hires for the job to be willing to receive new emails containing photo attachments multiple times a week</p>

            <h3 class="font-bold italic">Frustrations and Needs:</h3>
            <p >Julie wants to get a website portfolio setup to display her collage of photographs. She's tried to utilize Adobe's and other known portfolio software do this herself but she refuses to settle for using a template. She doesn't know anything about web development and needs someone that she can collaborate with to build her site and keep it updated. She is okay with hiring someone who only has a minimum of a year experience in web development but would prefer someone that has worked with other photographers. She'd like to have her site built within the next few weeks before she leaves on her next expedition. </p>
