                <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
                <p>Julie spends most of her time looking at a screen, whether that be on her camera, cell phone or her laptop focusing on capturing the perfect picture or tweaking it to look just right. She's extremely meticulous with how things look and it really frustrates her to see things unorganized. If a person's portfolio or resume isn't structured and displays creativity then she won't even spend more than a second to consider them as an option to hire. She expects the person she hires for the job to be willing to receive new emails containing photo attachments multiple times a week</p>

            <h3>Frustrations and Needs:</h3>
            <p>Julie wants to get a website portfolio setup to display her collage of photographs. She's tried to utilize Adobe's and other known portfolio software do this herself but she refuses to settle for using a template. She doesn't know anything about web development and needs someone that she can collaborate with to build her site and keep it updated. She is okay with hiring someone who only has a minimum of a year experience in web development but would prefer someone that has worked with other photographers. She'd like to have her site built within the next few weeks before she leaves on her next expedition. </p>
