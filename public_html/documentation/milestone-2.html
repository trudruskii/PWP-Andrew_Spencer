<!--I decided to use what I'd imagine a professional portfolio webpage could look like. Based on all of the UI/UX material I've been reading over the past week, it was advised not to try to twist up the structure of the page and attempt to be innovative. Therefore, I decided to keep it rather simple. I did add a little bit of flavor in the wireframe with some things that might be slightly challenging but I am absolutely confident that I can make a webpage look exactly as my wireframe does on both the pc/laptop wireframe and the mobile(responsive) wireframe. I will just need to utilize tab-cordian to make it what I need happen and it will add some definition to where my skill set is, hopefully.
