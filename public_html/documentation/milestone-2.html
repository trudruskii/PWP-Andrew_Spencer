        <h2 class="font-bold underline descriptThis">Brief Discription</h2>
        <p>I decided to construct what I'd imagine a professional portfolio webpage would look like. Based on all of the UI/UX material I've been reading over the past week, I decided not to try to deviate from the popular consensus and attempt to be extremely innovative. Therefore, I decided to keep it rather simple. I did add a little bit of flavor in the wireframe with some things that might be slightly challenging. However, I am absolutely confident that I can make a webpage look exactly as my wireframe does on both the pc/laptop wireframe and the mobile(responsive) wireframe. Below is a list specifying my content strategy for each section of my page.</p>

            <li>
                <h5 class="font-bold underline">Introduction Section:</h5>
                <p>Presents my name, profession, my personalized logo, some quick contact links and a page navigation bar</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5 class="font-bold underline">About me section:</h5>
                <p>Will give a little bit of a background on my professional standings (then and now type information), what I'm currently investing my time with in programming/development, the direction I'm heading with my education goals and what I'm looking for with my career. This section will also have a professional photograph of myself.</p>

            <li>
                <h5 class="font-bold underline">Portfolio section:</h5>
                <p>This section will provide more insight on my education background, what certifications I've had in the past and currently have, and my relevant professional history. I'm currently starting to work on a few projects/websites that I plan on show casing in this section as well. I'd like to provide a QR link to the capstone project I worked on as well to provide quick access to it if I'm on mobile and want to show off one of my bigger projects.</p>

                <h5 class="font-bold underline">Contact me section:</h5>
                <p>This will provide some detailed information on how a person can reach me and provide another link to connect with me now either by phone or email. Also this section will provide a form for a person to input their contact information to send me so that I can reach back out to them.</p>

                <h5 class="font-bold underline">Footer section:</h5>
                <p>This section of the page will include icons with embedded links to my professional social media profiles as optional ways to view more information about me or to get in touch with me. </p>

<!--        Content Strategy-->
<!--        My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:-->

<!--        Welcome: A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Front End Developer. This welcome message will be overlaid on a large background image of my home office setup.-->

<!--        About Me: This section will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional highlights. This section will showcase my strengths and personality. I will feature a contrasting sidebar that lists my core skills and programming languages which will be easily readable at a glance. The tone of voice will be personable and casual, as I am only interested in opportunities with individuals and organizations that I am a good personality fit for.-->

<!--        Portfolio: I want this to be an animated, responsive image gallery containing 4-6 examples of my best work. Gallery pop-up will include my role and contributions to each project, with iconography to represent the technology used.-->

<!--        Contact: This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address, and additional links to my professional social media profiles: LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble. (These will also be linked to in the footer site wide via icons.)-->
